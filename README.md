## Thank you to the following.
* TK3 created by Volker Bandke       vbandke@bsp-gmbh.com http://www.bsp-gmbh.com/turnkey
* TK4- update by Juergen Winkelmann  winkelmann@id.ethz.ch http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/

## Usage

```
docker run -dit --name tk4- \
           -p 3270:3270 -p 8038:8038 \
           rattydave/docker-ubuntu-hercules-mvs:latest
```

Connect a 3270 terminal to port 3270 on the docker host.
To get the http://docker.host:8038 for the Hercules console.

Or

```
docker run -dit --name tk4- rattydave/docker-ubuntu-hercules-mvs:latest

docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' tk4-
```

Then connect a 3270 terminal to the container ip address on port 3270.

```
x3270 ipaddress:3270
```

If you need a development system with x3270 pre installed then have a look at https://hub.docker.com/r/rattydave/docker-ubuntu-xrdp-mate-custom/ and pull rattydave/docker-ubuntu-xrdp-mate-custom:v2-tools


## Add Full Function Console when Running in Unattended Mode

Point a web browser to port 8038 of the host system running TK4-. This will typically
be 127.0.0.1, aka localhost.

Enter ```attach 010 3270 CONS``` in the command field of the web browser session.

Connect a tn3270 emulator of your choice to port 3270 of the host system running
TK4- (which typically will be docker host IP). Use CONS for the LUNAME (or equivalent)
connection parameter of the tn3270 client. A panel showing the TK4- logo and
information about Hercules and the host operating system will be displayed.

Enter ```/v 010,console,auth=all``` in the command field of the web browser session. An MVS console will now be
activated in the tn3270 session.

It is recommended to press PF11 at the newly activated console at this point. This will remove the annoying default display area which occupies most of the console’s output area. Alternatively PF23 can be used if in addition the popular ```mn jobnames,t``` and ```mn sess,t``` commands are to be issued

## Basic TCP/IP Support

Jason Winter’s TCPIP instruction (opcode X’75’) has been re-fitted to work with the Hercules version that comes with TK4-. The instruction dates back to 2002 and was last updated around 2009. It allows the Hercules guest to access the IP stack of the host system on which Hercules is running. The current implementation provides the complete functionality as
designed in 2002/2009.

However, from today’s point of view, the given implementation may compromise the TK4- security concept and attract risks from the network. Before trying to use TCP/IP connectivity it is strongly recommended to read TSO HELP member TCPIP. Besides providing detailed usage instructions it also explains possible risks and strategies to avoid them.
